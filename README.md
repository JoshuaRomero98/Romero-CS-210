# Romero-CS-210
Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

The project was to make a program that demonstrates the frequency of words in a list. 
-The funtion brough the user to main menu and gave them options for displaying the data.



What did you do particularly well?

-I implemented a class that limited the amount of code needed in main. 


Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

-More input validation and way to reinitialize the main menu after choosing an optipn would improve the code.
This would "error-proof" the code allowing for more functiionality and more secure. 



Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

-Using maps was most difficult part as I had not yet used this function. 
I was forced to do research on its functionality. I utlized sources like zybooks, and other online resources.



What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
-One skill that was particullary useful was how to organize the code. Putting functions within classes is good way to ensure that not much code is needed in main.
This will help with the organization and implementation of more complex code



How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
My code be used with any files similar to the one used. It is commented out so it can be modyfied later and is more understable.
